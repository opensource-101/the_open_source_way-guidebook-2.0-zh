## 开源之路的呈现

An English idiom says, "There is a method to my madness."[^1 ] Most of the time, the things we do
make absolutely no sense to outside observers. Out of context, they look like sheer madness. But for
those inside that messiness—inside that whirlwind of activity—there’s a certain regularity, a
certain predictability, and a certain motive. A method.

A method is a _way of doing something_ , a particular manner or style of practice. The practice of open
source community management can seem like its own form of incomprehensible madness,
especially to someone who is unfamiliar with how open source software gets made, or those who
find themselves staring down the prospect of having to coordinate others to join in making it. What
this guide hopes to provide is some insight into an ever-evolving methodology, a form of practice.
At its core is a simple question: What are your preferences for practicing the open source way?

But beyond that, this work is really digging into the question of _why_ someone might do the work
this way. Why use this or that method to organize the madness?

So from this introduction you should take two important points:

1. There is a _what_ , a _how_ , and a _why_ to the practice of successfully and sustainably creating and
    maintaining open source software.
2. This guide distills opinions from a sizeable group of open source practitioners, the kind of
    people always having to answer the question of, "Why do we do this open source thing the way
    we do it?"

In particular, this guide is a living document that endeavors to gather and spread a diverse group of
voices who are similarly (and somewhat-opinionatedly) collecting the best ways to create and
manage an open source software community.

These voices are all part of this community of practice around open source software community
management.
