## 吸引用户

This section gives important, highly useful, and timely advice on some of the most important parts
of what makes an open source software project successful. We put them in this section with the goal
of helping to attract users, rather than saving, for example, communication or diversity
considerations as later steps in the engagement toward contributor.
本节就如何使开源软件项目成功的一些最重要部分提供了重要、非常有用和及时的建议。我们将它们放在本节中的目的是帮助吸引用户，而不是将交流或多样性考虑作为参与贡献者的后续步骤。

This guidebook says the way to grow a contributor community is through user adoption. There are
a few succinct reasons why.
之所以这本指南会说通过采纳用户来发展贡献者社区。原因有几个，简单明了。

One is a sheer numbers argument: the larger the pool of people, the more will become interested in
participating, then contributing. The more diverse the pool of people, the larger it can be. That is, if
only men feel welcome in your project, you have reduced the size of your pool of users/contributors
to less than half of the population of humanity.
一个是纯粹的数字理论：人数越多，参与的兴趣就越大，越有贡献。人才库越多样化，规模也就越大。换句话说说，如果在你的项目中只有男性感到受欢迎，那么你已经将你的用户/贡献者池的规模减少到不到人类人口的一半。

Expert contributors rarely arrive suddenly and ready to contribute. More people become
contributors through a pathway of becoming a user of the software first, then participating in the
wider user community, and eventually becoming a starting contributor. After some time (short or
long), their expertise is realized within the community. More people who start this pathway means
more people will complete it.
专家贡献者很少会突然加入并准备为项目贡献。更多的人以先成为软件用户，然后参与更广泛的用户社区，最终成为初始贡献者的途径成为贡献者。然后经过一段时间（或短或长），他们的专业知识便会在社区内用到。更多的人开始这条道路意味着更多的人将完成它。

Diversity and communication also come at the front of a project. Communication is important for
sharing with the world what your software does and why they should use it; and to capture their
feedback in effective forums. Diversity and inclusivity are goals that provide strength for
innovation, resilience, and long-term sustainability. If your community doesn’t look like this world,
it won’t last long in this world.
多样性和沟通也是项目的首要任务。交流对于与世界分享你的软件的功能，以及他们为什么要使用它是很重要的；在有效的论坛上收集用户们的反馈。多样性和包容性可以为创新、恢复力和长期可持续性提供动力。如果你的社区看起来不像这个世界，它在这个世界上不会持续很久。

A way to think of this is: The first time someone sees your community has a formal Code of Conduct
and diverse faces in leadership should be the first time they visit your website. The people who
most need to see themselves represented in the community already—to know they are going to be
safe physically and emotionally in joining—are going to make their decision about how welcoming
your community is from the first time they visit your project website. Without these sort of
elements visibly part of the culture, these folks are going to be long gone before considering
becoming involved as collaborators and contributors.
有一种思考方式是：有人第一次看到你的社区有正式的行为准则和领导人的新面孔的时候，应该是他们第一次访问你的网站。那些最需要看到自己在社区中有代表性的人，来知道他们将可以安全地加入社区，他们将从第一次访问你的项目网站时就决定如何欢迎你的社区。如果文化中没有这些明显的元素，这些人在考虑成为合作者和贡献者之前，早就离开了。
